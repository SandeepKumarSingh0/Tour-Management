# Tour-Management
Overview
The project was bootstrapped using Create React App, a convenient tool to quickly start a React project with minimal configuration.

Available Scripts
Several commands are available to run in the project's root directory:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode, opening it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

npm test: Launches the test runner in watch mode, allowing you to run tests interactively.

npm run build: Bundles the app for production, creating an optimized version in the build folder. This includes minification, and the files are ready for deployment.

npm run eject: Allows you to access and customize the underlying configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint). This is a one-way operation, and you cannot reverse it once done.

Learning Resources
Create React App Documentation: Provides detailed guides on features such as code splitting, analyzing bundle size, configuring the app, and deploying.

React Documentation: The official React documentation is recommended for learning and deepening your understanding of React.

Troubleshooting
npm run build fails to minify: A section dedicated to troubleshooting build issues when minification fails during the production build.
